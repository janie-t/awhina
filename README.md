# ƒÅwhina

Awhina means support, in Maori. It is a resource for youth to get easy and quick access to a variety of media, especially targetted towards positive mental and physcial health.

It is a work in progress. Currently only the Motivation section is working.

The idea is that the user will click on a topic that they want some quick, helpful advice on. For example they may be feeling like they are not motivated, or have a goal they want to reach - so they click on Motivation.
They are taken to a new page with a media file automatically loaded. The media could be video, text or image.
Users can then click on the button to be given another random file.

Further functionality:
I want to be able to choose the media type and see only that type e.g. just videos
I want to be able to share the media file to social media e.g. facebook or twitter sharing capability
I want to be able to rate the media file ie. thumbs up or down, and if I don't like it I won't be shown it again.
